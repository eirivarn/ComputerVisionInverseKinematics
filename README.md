# Real-Time Hand Position Tracking and Articulated Robot Arm Simulation

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a software application designed for real-time tracking of hand position and orientation. The primary goal is to simulate an "" that is controlled through inverse kinematics based on the observed hand movements in an image. The focus is on creating an efficient and accurate system capable of handling real-time simulations.

## Setup

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.11
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Create a virtual environment:

  ```
  python3.11 -m venv venv
  ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

  ```
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS/Linux:

  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

5. Install the required packages using `requirements.txt`:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. If you update the the current packages in the `requirements.txt` use:
    ```
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    This command lists all the installed packages in the current environment along with their versions and saves them to `requirements.txt`.

## Usage

To use the project, simply run your Python scripts within the activated virtual environment.
